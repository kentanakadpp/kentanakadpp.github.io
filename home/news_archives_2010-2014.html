<p> [Dec. 23, 2014] The day before yesterday, a paper 
	"A new method of convergence acceleration of series expansion for analytic functions in the complex domain"
	was accepted for publication in <a href="http://link.springer.com/journal/13160" rel="nofollow">Japan Journal of Industrial and Applied Mathematics</a>. 
	This is a joint work with Prof. Sunao Murashige (see <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ketanakahp/links">List of Coauthors</a>). 
	</p>
<p> [Dec. 23, 2014] On Dec. 18, 2014, I read my paper "A fast and accurate numerical method for symmetric Levy processes"
	（対称Levy過程に対する高速高精度数値計算法） at <a href="http://mmc01.es.hokudai.ac.jp/CAM/2014/index.html" rel="nofollow">
	"Joint conference of applied mathematics 2014" （2014年度 応用数学合同研究集会）</a>.
	This paper is a condensed written summary of the preprint <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.0157" rel="nofollow">arXiv:1408.0157</a>
	released on Aug. 01, 2014 as written below. </p>
<p> [Dec. 12, 2014] A few days ago, an article
	"Error estimate and convergence analysis of moment-preserving discrete approximations of continuous distributions" 
	was published in AIP conference proceedings. 
	This article is available on <a href="http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/proceeding/aipcp/10.1063/1.4903706" rel="nofollow">this site</a>.</p>
<p> [Aug. 25, 2014] This page is renewed.</p>
<p> [Aug. 01, 2014] A new preprint 
	"A fast and accurate numerical method for the symmetric Levy processes based on the Fourier transform and sinc-Gauss sampling formula" 
	is released in <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.0157" rel="nofollow">arXiv:1408.0157</a>. 
	In this preprint, I have proposed a numerical method for the Kolmogorov forward equations of Levy processes.</p>
