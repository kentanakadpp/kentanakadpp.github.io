<p> [Oct. 24, 2024]
	I gave a talk entitled "On attempt for computation of general matrix functions by numerical integration" 
	(in Japanese) in <a href="https://na.nuap.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~rims2024/">a conference</a> held at 
	Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences, Kyoto University. 
</p>

<p>  [Oct. 18, 2024]
	A new paper 
	<a href="https://doi.org/10.1137/24M1634163">"How Sharp Are Error Bounds? –Lower Bounds on Quadrature Worst-Case Errors for Analytic Functions–"</a>
	has been published in SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis.  
	This is a paper corresponding to the preprint announced below on Jan. 17, 2024.
</p>

<p>  [Oct. 1, 2024]
	I have become a professor at <a href="https://www.isct.ac.jp/en">Institute of Science Tokyo</a>
	(former <a href="https://www.titech.ac.jp/english">Tokyo Institute of Technology</a>). 
</p>

<p> [Sep. 18, 2024]
	I gave a talk in <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/jmcqmc/%E3%83%9B%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A0/jmcqmc02?authuser=0">the Second Workshop of JMCQMC -In Celebration of 50th Birthday of Prof. Josef Dick-</a>.
	This workshop was organized by Prof. Takashi Goda, who invited me to it. 
	My talk was concerned with the same content as what I presented in the annual conference of JSIAM four days ago. 
</p>

<p> [Sep. 16, 2024]
	From Sep. 14 to Sep. 16 in 2024,
	I participated in 
	<a href="https://jsiam.org/annual2024/">the annual conference of Japan Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics (JSIAM) of AY2024</a>, 
	which was held at <a href="https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en">Kyoto University</a>. In this conference, 
	I gave a talk about our paper "How sharp are error bounds? ---lower bounds on quadrature worst-case errors for analytic functions---", 
	which was accepted for publication in 
	<a href="https://www.siam.org/publications/siam-journals/siam-journal-on-numerical-analysis/">SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis</a>. 
	Furthermore, Two of my master's graduate students gave talks about their work at this conference. 
</p>
	
<p> [May. 9, 2024]
	A new paper "Analysis of continuous dynamical system models with Hessians derived from optimization methods" 
	(<a href="https://doi.org/10.14495/jsiaml.16.29">webpage</a>)
	has been published. 
	This paper is concerned with dynamical systems that correspond to optimization algorithms. 
	The research of this paper was done in collaboration with several members of 
	<a href="http://www.sr3.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/">my laboratory</a>. 
</p>

<p> [Jan. 17, 2024]
My new preprint 
"How sharp are error bounds? ---lower bounds on quadrature worst-case errors for analytic functions---"
(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07196">arXiv:2401.07196</a>)
has been published by a collaborative effort with Takashi Goda and Yoshihito Kazashi.<br>

&emsp; In this preprint, we establish matching lower bounds for the worst-case errors of 
renowned numerical integration formulas on the real axis within the context of weighted Hardy spaces. 
Furthermore, we demonstrate the sharpness of their existing upper bounds.<br>

&emsp; Considering the extensive reliance on one-dimensional integration as a subroutine 
in numerous scientific computing applications, our findings hold wide-ranging implications. 
They cater not only to experts in numerical integration but also extend to practitioners in the field.
